Wherever you are - be all there.
Jim Elliot

Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life.
Jimmy Dean

There is progress whether ye are going forward or backward! The thing is to move!
Edgar Cayce

To know oneself, one should assert oneself.
Albert Camus

One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low.
Thomas Fuller

There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.
Richard Rorty

What is called genius is the abundance of life and health.
Henry David Thoreau

To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life.
Robert Louis Stevenson

Do not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand.
Baruch Spinoza

Be thine own palace, or the world's thy jail.
John Donne

You never know what motivates you.
Cicely Tyson

The weeds keep multiplying in our garden, which is our mind ruled by fear. Rip them out and call them by name.
Sylvia Browne

When one must, one can.
Charlotte Whitton

The dog that trots about finds a bone.
Golda Meir

Only the educated are free.
Epictetus

Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.
Leo Buscaglia

A will finds a way.
Orison Swett Marden

One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.
Herman Cain

People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.
Lenny Kravitz

I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.
Peter Steele

Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are.
Keke Palmer

I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life.
J. R. Martinez

I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that's about so you can represent it.
Edward Norton

I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don't accept your limitations, jump before you're pushed, leap before you look.
Louise Mensch

Typically, if you reward something, you get more of it. You punish something, you get less of it. And our businesses have been built for the last 150 years very much on that kind of motivational scheme.
Daniel H. Pink
